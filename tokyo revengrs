      Quoted from Tokyo Revengers Fandom, the Tokyo Revengers season 1 anime
      consists of 24 episodes. Each episode lasts approximately 24 minutes. The
      story begins with a 26 year old man named Hanagaki Takemichi. He is a part
      time employee at a DVD rental shop. One afternoon, he was watching
      television while eating snacks in his small rental room. In the television
      broadcast, he saw news of an accident that killed a 26 year old girl named
      Tachibana Hinata and her sister Tachibana Naoto.Takemichi remembered that
      the name Tachibana Hinata was similar to the name of his ex-girlfriend
      from middle school. However, 12 years had passed and he had never met
      Hinata. On his way home from work, Takemichi waited for the train on the
      platform near the train track. Suddenly someone pushed him when the train
      came. Takemichi saw the light from the train lights which was so bright
      that he closed his eyes. When he opened his eyes, he was in front of a
      mirror at school. Takemichi was surprised to see his appearance back to
      middle school. When he looked at his cellphone in his pocket, he saw that
      the date on the cellphone showed July 4, 2005. He spent the whole day with
      his friends and got into a fight with a class 3 gang at his junior high
      school. Takemichi realized he had returned to the past because he slowly
      remembered all the events he had experienced in the last 12 years. In the
      afternoon he met Naoto, Hinata's younger brother. They chat in the park
      and Takemichi says Hinata and Naoto will die 12 years later in an
      accident. "Promise to always look after Hinata," Takemichi said and shook
      Naoto's hand.
